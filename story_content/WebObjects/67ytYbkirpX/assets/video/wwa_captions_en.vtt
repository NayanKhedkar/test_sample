00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.929
Before working in the lab,

2
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.390
consult the SDS for specific hazards

3
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.350
relating to the chemicals you are using.

4
00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.311
Ensure you are wearing

5
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.188
appropriate attire and PPE

6
00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.232
to minimize eye and skin exposure.

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.614
Also make yourself familiar with

8
00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.950
the location of all necessary emergency

9
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.994
equipment and your lab’s procedure

10
00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.579
for cleaning up chemical spills.

11
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.207
See the module “Safety Controls and PPE”

12
00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.834
for a review of this information.

13
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.719
Before weighing out a liquid,

14
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.387
you will retrieve some of this liquid

15
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.638
from the stock container.

16
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.727
Always pour your reagent into a

17
00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.021
secondary container before use to

18
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.898
protect the liquid in the stock bottle

19
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.357
from becoming contaminated

20
00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:08.109
and to make it easier to transfer

21
00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.819
your liquid to your weighing vessel.

22
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.322
To choose an appropriate secondary

23
00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.324
container, consider the reagent

24
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.326
you are using and verify container

25
00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.995
compatibility by looking at the SDS.

26
00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:20.580
If you are working with

27
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.916
a hazardous chemical, it is best to use

28
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.375
a container that can be capped

29
00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.878
to avoid any splashing or evaporation

30
00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.630
and to minimize your exposure.

31
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.549
Since we are using DI water, we will

32
00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.802
use a beaker for this demonstration.

33
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.058
Double-check the chemical name and

34
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.185
hazards listed on the stock container

35
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.686
before you pour any out into

36
00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.188
your secondary container.

37
00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.367
Label your secondary container

38
00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.536
before you add any reagent to it.

39
00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.538
Gently pour the liquid into

40
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.915
the secondary container, taking care

41
00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.500
to keep the reagent as far from

42
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.960
your face as possible.

43
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.342
Pour out only a small amount more

44
00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:15.385
than you think you will need

45
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.511
to reduce waste.

46
00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:37.699
Inspect the balance and familiarize

47
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.367
yourself with the balance display

48
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.994
before you measure anything.

49
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:43.371
The maximum weight that the balance

50
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.956
can weigh is here.

51
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.668
The number of spaces after the decimal

52
00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.879
point the balance can read is here.

53
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.673
To confirm that the balance is level,

54
00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.049
look at this bubble here.

55
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.677
The bubble should be in the center.

56
00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.762
If it is not level,

57
00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.973
notify someone in your lab responsible

58
00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.516
for leveling the balances.

59
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.393
If you are allowed to level

60
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.604
the balance yourself, adjust the feet

61
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.855
of the balance to level it

62
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.565
before you do anything else.

63
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.276
Once level, press 0

64
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.278
in order to zero the balance.

65
00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:17.447
The tare button, found here,

66
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.324
will be used in our next step.

67
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.165
Now that you have your sample

68
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.833
and you have inspected the balance,

69
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.044
collect all items necessary for the

70
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.004
procedure, including a collection

71
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.589
container for liquid waste.

72
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.966
Label your waste container.

73
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.677
Set up everything next to the balance

74
00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:41.471
you will use and make sure it is all

75
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.057
in easy reach. This includes

76
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.351
your lab wipes, transfer pipettes,

77
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.685
and your weighing vessel.

78
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.777
Open the door of the balance,

79
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.906
Place the weighing vessel

80
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.574
in the center of the balance plate,

81
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.535
Close the doors.

82
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.789
Wait for the reading to stabilize,

83
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.082
and tare the balance.

84
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.460
If you are sharing the balance

85
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.837
with multiple people, it may be wiser

86
00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:16.381
to write down the weight of your vessel

87
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.216
instead of using the tare function.

88
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.760
Be sure to choose a container that

89
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.470
easily fits in the balance and will

90
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.180
also be within the weight limit for

91
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.182
the balance when you add the reagent.

92
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.601
If you are weighing out a liquid,

93
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.144
it is because the mass of liquid

94
00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:31.729
matters for your experiment.

95
00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.856
All liquids are volatile

96
00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.442
to some degree, even aqueous solutions,

97
00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.735
so it is best to use a

98
00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:38.945
capped container.

99
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.495
Now you can start measuring out

100
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.579
your DI water.

101
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.124
Be sure to double check how much water

102
00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.251
you are weighing out before you begin.

103
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.254
Add the water to the weighing vessel by

104
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.463
either pouring it in or

105
00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.132
using a transfer pipette.

106
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.926
In this case, a plastic transfer

107
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.886
pipette is being used because this is

108
00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.346
compatible with water.

109
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.807
If the chemical you are weighing is not

110
00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.184
compatible with plastic, use a glass

111
00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:12.103
Pasteur pipette for the transfer.

112
00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.159
When you want to weigh the amount

113
00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.202
of liquid transferred so far,

114
00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:29.787
close the door of the balance and

115
00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:31.956
wait until the reading stabilizes.

116
00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.380
If you find that you have not added

117
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.424
enough, you can uncap the tube

118
00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.759
and add more water.

119
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.345
You can use an estimated difference

120
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.346
from what is being weighed

121
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.514
to determine how much water to add.

122
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.725
Keep in mind that this is only

123
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.518
an estimate because the weight does not

124
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.187
include the cap and the door to

125
00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.439
the analytical balance is open.

126
00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.816
Be sure to add the additional water

127
00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:00.234
one drop at a time.

128
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.328
When weighing the sample again,

129
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.080
replace the cap and close the door

130
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.122
to the balance.

131
00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:27.720
If you have added too much water

132
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.847
to the tube, remove excess water

133
00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:31.057
from the weighing vessel using

134
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.475
a transfer pipette.

135
00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.411
Be sure to dispose of the liquid

136
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.496
you remove into your waste container,

137
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.665
not back into the secondary container.

138
00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.210
Again, when checking the new weight,

139
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.628
be sure to replace the cap

140
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.588
and close the door to the balance.

141
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.470
When you have reached the correct

142
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.472
weight, record the exact reading

143
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.473
in your notebook.

144
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.324
Remove the weighing vessel from

145
00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:32.493
the balance, and wipe the balance down

146
00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:34.245
with lint-free lab wipes.

147
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.414
Be careful not to put weight on

148
00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.249
the plate when wiping it down.
