[Intro music]

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.500
Before working in the lab, consult the 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.960
SDS for specific hazards relating to 

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:17.309
the chemicals you are using. 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.480
Ensure you are wearing appropriate 

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:22.789
attire and PPE to minimize eye 

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:23.899
and skin exposure. 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.469
Also make yourself familiar with the 

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:33.719
location of all necessary emergency 

00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:35.820
equipment and your lab's procedure for 

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:37.320
cleaning up chemical spills. 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.880
See the module "Safety Controls and PPE" 

00:00:40.963 --> 00:00:42.570
for a review of this information. 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.820
Before weighing out a solid, 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.710
you will retrieve some of this solid 

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:53.820
from the stock container. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.880
Always transfer your reagent into a 

00:00:56.963 --> 00:00:59.070
secondary container before use to 

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:00.509
protect the solid in the stock 

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.520
container from becoming contaminated 

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:04.500
and to make it easier to transfer your 

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:05.939
solid to your weighing vessel. 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.980
To choose an appropriate 

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:10.079
secondary container, consider the 

00:01:10.163 --> 00:01:12.090
reagent you are using and verify 

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:14.040
container compatibility by looking 

00:01:14.123 --> 00:01:15.030
at the SDS. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.150
In this case, we will be using copper 

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:20.700
(II) sulfate pentahydrate, so we will 

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:21.810
be using this beaker. 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.909
Double check the chemical name and 

00:01:23.993 --> 00:01:25.939
hazards listed on the stock container 

00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:27.569
before you pour any out into 

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:28.859
your secondary container. 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.260
Label your secondary container before 

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:35.909
you add any reagent to it. 

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:37.439
Note that there may be more 

00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:39.329
requirements in your lab for what would 

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:40.170
go on the label. 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.170
Use a spatula to gently transfer an 

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.150
approximate amount of the chemical into 

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:46.379
the secondary container. 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.170
Note that the transfer should be gentle 

00:01:49.253 --> 00:01:51.030
to reduce production of aerosols. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.189
Only return the used spatula if these 

00:01:57.273 --> 00:01:59.170
spatulas are being used to transfer 

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:00.189
the same reagent. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.590
Then recap the container. 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.430
Collect all items necessary for 

00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:12.409
the procedure, including a labeled 

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:14.449
collection container for solid waste. 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.500
Set up everything next to the balance 

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:22.389
you will use and make sure it is all in 

00:02:22.473 --> 00:02:25.000
easy reach without having to overextend 

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.110
or slouch your body. 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.030
This includes your lab wipes, 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.770
spatula,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.719
balance cleaning brush,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.419
and weighing vessel. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.750
Inspect the chemical in your secondary 

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.610
container for consistent color and 

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:46.800
chunks of solid, which you can grind up 

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:48.030
or remove to the solid 

00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:48.930
waste container. 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.969
Inspect the balance before you begin. 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.460
If there is some solid chemical 

00:02:54.543 --> 00:02:55.930
left over on the balance from 

00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:56.860
a previous use. 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.139
Gently sweep off the leftover chemical 

00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:01.689
with a clean, dry brush and dispose of 

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:03.759
the debris in the solid waste container. 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.150
Inspect the balance and familiarize 

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:23.830
yourself with the balance display 

00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:25.210
before you measure anything. 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.580
The maximum weight that the balance can 

00:03:28.663 --> 00:03:29.300
weigh is here. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.069
The number of spaces after the decimal 

00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:34.990
point the balance can read is here. 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.110
To confirm that the balance is level, 

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:39.400
look at this bubble here. 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.080
The bubble should be in the center. 

00:03:43.163 --> 00:03:43.949
If it is not level,

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.409
notify someone in your lab responsible 

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:47.789
for leveling the balances. 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.099
If you are allowed to level the 

00:03:50.183 --> 00:03:52.139
balance yourself, adjust the feet of 

00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:53.849
the balance to level it before you 

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:54.870
do anything else. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.400
Once level, press 0 in order to 

00:03:58.483 --> 00:03:59.449
zero the balance. 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.569
The tare button, found here, will be used 

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:03.560
in our next step. 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.280
Several options are available in this 

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:13.810
case for the weighing container, 

00:04:13.893 --> 00:04:15.069
including a weigh boat, 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:17.759
weigh paper,

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.689
and glassware such as a test tube. It is 

00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:25.399
important that the weighing container 

00:04:25.483 --> 00:04:27.620
be reasonably low mass in relation to 

00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:28.850
the amount of solid you are 

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:29.689
about to weigh. 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.920
For the purposes of 

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:32.689
this demonstration, we will use 

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:33.399
the weigh boat. 

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.910
Take the container you are using and 

00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:40.110
place it on the balance. 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.839
The container should easily fit into 

00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:45.029
the space without disrupting operation 

00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:45.810
of the balance. 

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:47.759
Based on the mass of 

00:04:47.843 --> 00:04:48.779
the weighing container,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.939
reconfirm that you will not be over the 

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:53.009
load limit for the balance once you add 

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.600
the required amount of the solid. 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.329
Tare the balance by pressing the T 

00:04:57.413 --> 00:04:58.769
button and then move the weighing 

00:04:58.853 --> 00:05:00.120
container from the balance 

00:05:00.203 --> 00:05:00.870
to your bench. 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.649
Use a spatula to transfer a closer 

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:20.480
estimated amount of the solid from the 

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:21.949
secondary container into 

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:22.939
the weighing container. 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.819
Place the weighing apparatus back 

00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:30.529
on the scale, 

00:05:30.612 --> 00:05:32.670
close the doors, and allow the weight to 

00:05:32.753 --> 00:05:34.319
stabilize before reading it. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.660
The doors must be closed to prevent 

00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:38.610
subtle air currents around the balance 

00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:40.019
from disrupting the measurement. 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.540
If the weight is lower than desired, 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.029
use the spatula to add more solid from 

00:05:45.113 --> 00:05:46.720
the secondary container into the weigh 

00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:47.939
boat on the balance. 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.699
Avoid pushing down on the plate of the 

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.139
balance with the spatula. 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.949
Close the doors, allow the measurement 

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:59.110
to stabilize, and read the new weight. 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.370
If the transferred solid weighs more 

00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:10.800
than desired, use the spatula to remove 

00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:11.740
a small amount - 

00:06:11.823 --> 00:06:14.160
again, being careful not to push down 

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:15.149
on the balance plate. 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.329
Dispose of any material you remove from 

00:06:18.413 --> 00:06:19.829
the weighing apparatus into the 

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:21.120
solid waste container. 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.089
Close the doors and allow the 

00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:28.259
weight to stabilize. 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:30.889
Once you are close enough to the 

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.600
desired weight for your experiment, 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.370
note the actual mass in 

00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:35.360
your lab notebook. 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.449
Remove the weighing container 

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:44.230
from the scale. 

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:52.959
Finally, inspect the scale. 

00:06:53.043 --> 00:06:53.949
If you spilled anything, 

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:56.350
be sure to gently brush away any powder, 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.670
and dispose of it in the 

00:06:57.753 --> 00:06:58.930
solid waste container. 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.230
Dispose of your waste in the 

00:07:10.313 --> 00:07:11.639
appropriate waste container.
