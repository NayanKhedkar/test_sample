NOTE This VTT file includes a few extras:
- Meta data at the top (lines 2 and 3)
- The current comment block, identified with NOTE and surrounded by spaces
- cue settings at the end of the first timestamp
- A cue span at the start of the second cue payload
- (in this case, a "voice span" <v> identifying the speaker)
- A WebVTT cue settings list after the timestamp at 39.132
- Currently AblePlayer does not support these extra features
- but the parser needs to be able to filter them out
-
- Added on April 1, 2015 for testing purposes (these are both valid):
- A cue block with no content
- Multiple line breaks between some cue blocks
-
- More info in the WebVTT spec (still evolving):

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.845
Let's look at three important things to consider when using gloves,


00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.464
generally gloves come in three sizes.


00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:11.063
Glove boxes are accordingly marked, small medium and large respectively.


00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:15.337
Select the glove size that fits your hands well.


00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.587
flex your fingers and turn your gloved hands back and forth


00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:21.936
Ensure the fit is right not too tight and not too loose.


00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:28.909
While your gloves are on your hands, do not touch your face or common surfaces


00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:33.793
such as doors to prevent the transfer of chemicals, from the gloves to other locations.


00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:38.671
Finally, when your experiment is complete,


00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.841
remove the gloves and wash your hands before exiting the lab.
